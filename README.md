# OptimizationByMarginals

## Introduction
In microeconomics, firms can optimize production by identifying the point where the change in profit equals the change in cost. This program in Python will do the following:

1. Ask the user to say what input the firm is using to vary production
2. Ask what is the minimum and maximum number of units that can be produced
2. Ask the user how much the input can be increased or decreased during production
3. Ask the user to enter the total costs and total profits every time the input is varied
4. Display the optimal level of production

## Examples
### The Quilter
A quilter uses balls of yarn to vary the number of quilts they produce each week and can only purchase and use one ball of yarn at a time. They want to find out what the optimal amount of production is when they purchase one to six balls of yarn. When prompted for the total cost and total profit the following information:

| Total Cost | Total Profit |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| $1.00      | $10.00       |
| $2.00      | $16.00       |
| $3.00      | $18.00       |
| $4.00      | $19.00       |
| $5.00      | $19.00       |
| $6.00      | $18.00       |

The program should show that the optimal level of production occurs at four balls of yarn.

### The Factory
A factory uses the number of hours worked by their manufacturing crew to vary the number of cars they produce each day. The factory manager can only change the number hours by fifty each time. Currently, the factory can accomidate a staff working 100 hours and at max 350 hours. When prompted for the total cost and total profit the following information:

| Total Cost     | Total Profit     |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| $5,000.00      | $10,000.00       |
| $6,500.00      | $14,000.00       |
| $8,000.00      | $17,000.00       |
| $9,500.00      | $19,500.00       |
| $11,000.00     | $21,000.00       |
| $12,500.00     | $22,000.00       |

The program should show that the optimal level of production occurs at 300 hours of labor.
